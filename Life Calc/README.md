This project was developed for a Technology Student Association Competition in the competiting event of Software Development. The idea behind this was to create a tool that would aid teenagers and young adults in financing college and their life. We recognized that early adults and teens weren't recieving the necessary financial skills to effeciently plan for the financial obligations of paying for college, buying a house, or balancing a budget. Therefore, with a tool like ours, students can easily input various stats and get an overview of their financial future.
