# Veer-s-Projects
These are a raw collection of an array of projects I have worked on during my high school years. Ultimately the best project to check that demonstrates my aptitude would be the AICompetition and Classy. However, feel free to check out the rest of my projects as they may show insight to my growth as a developer.
